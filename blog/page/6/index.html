  <p>True story, just happened today. I was trying to fit a Poisson likelihood to estimate event cycle times (in discreet weeks). For certain columns, everything went perfectly fine. Yet for other columns, I was getting negative infinity’s likelihoods, and was banging my head over this problem for over an hour and a half.</p>
<p>As things turned out, those columns that gave me negative infinity likelihood initializations were doing so because of negative values in the data. Try fitting a Poisson likelihood, which only has positive support, on that!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/1yl6ki.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This lost hour and a half was a good lesson in data checking/testing: <strong>always be sure to sanity check basic stats associated with the data - bounds (min/max), central tendency (mean/median/mode) and spread (variance, quartile range) - always check!</strong></p>

  <p>I've been giving this some thought, and wanted to go out on a limb to put forth this idea:</p>
<p><strong>I think Random Forests (RF) are a good "baseline" model to try, after establishing a "random" baseline case.</strong></p>
<p>(Clarification: I'm using RF as a shorthand for "forest-based ML algorithms", including XGBoost etc.)</p>
<p>Before I go on, let me first provide some setup.</p>
<p>Let's say we have a two-class classification problem. Assume everything is balanced. One "dumb baseline"" case is a coin flip. The other "dumb baseline" is predicting everything to be one class. Once we have these established, we can go to a "baseline" machine learning model.</p>
<p>Usually, people might say, "go do logistic regression (LR)" as your first baseline model for classification problems. It sure is a principled choice! Logistic regression is geared towards classification problems, makes only linear assumptions about the data, and identifies directional effects as well. From a practical perspective, it's also very fast to train.</p>
<p>But I've found myself more and more being oriented towards using RFs as my baseline model instead of logistic regression. Here are my reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Practically speaking, any modern computer can train a RF model with ~1000+ trees in not much more time than it would need for an LR model.</li>
<li>By using RFs, we do not make linearity assumptions about the data.</li>
<li>Additionally, we don't have to scale the data (one less thing to do).</li>
<li>RFs will automatically learn non-linear interaction terms in the data, which is not possible without further feature engineering in LR.</li>
<li>As such, the out-of-the-box performance using large RFs with default settings is often very good, making for a much more intellectually interesting challenge in trying to beat that classifier.</li>
<li>With <code>scikit-learn</code>, it's a one-liner change to swap out LR for RF. The API is what matters, and as such, drop-in replacements are easily implemented!</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to be clear, I'm not advocating for throwing away logistic regression altogether. There are moments where interpretability is needed, and is more easily done by using LR. In those cases, LR can be the "baseline model", or even just back-filled in after training the baseline RF model for comparison.</p>
<p>Random Forests were the darling of the machine learning world before neural networks came along, and even now, remain the tool-of-choice for colleagues in the cheminformatics world. Given how easy they are to use now, why not just start with them?</p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>I recently read a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nrg.2017.38.html">review paper on network propagation</a>. It looks like a very useful thing in data science, particularly where networks are involved, and I wanted to share it with everybody.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I will start off by assuming we have a dataset modelled as a "network", or a "graph", in which the nodes are entities in the graph, and edges are relationships between those entities. In the context of my work, I encounter biological networks of many kinds - gene-gene interactions, protein-protein interactions, protein-RNA interactions, evolutionary networks, and more.</p>
<p>What kind of problems can network propagation solve? The problem class generally follows this logic: I start with some nodes of interest, and I'm most interested in finding other nodes of interest based on these "seed" nodes. Knowing that path-based methods can often end up over-prioritizing highly connected nodes, we need a different principled method for finding these nodes. One way would be to take a random walk on the graph, and find out how often we land on a particular set of nodes on the graph. This random walk is what we call "network propagation".</p>
<h2 id="how-network-propagation-works">How network propagation works</h2><p>Network propagation follows this intuition: Imagine nodes contain information, and edges dictate which nodes information can be shared with. Network propagation shares the information with other nodes, according to the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can only share by copying to my neighbours in the graph,</li>
<li>I must share everything that I have with my neighbours, and</li>
<li>Exchanges in the graph happen simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>An animation of how this works is shown below.</p>
<p>If you take my DataCamp course, you'll learn that networks can be represented as matrices on a computer. The adjacency matrix can be a 1/0 (i.e. binary) matrix that describes how nodes (rows and columns) are connected, and nodes can have their own vector of information (i.e. whether they are "seed" nodes or not). As it turns out, network propagation has a very nice matrix representation:</p>
<h2 id="how-to-implement-network-propagation">How to implement network propagation</h2><p>So, how do we do network propagation with NetworkX, <code>numpy</code> and Python? Let's take a look at code. Firstly, <strong>how do you convert a graph to a <code>numpy</code> matrix</strong>?</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Assume we have a graph G. Convert it to a numpy matrix.</span>
<span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_numpy_matrix</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">G</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
<p>This basically corresponds to the following graph:</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2017/10/22/network-propagation/graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Great! Now, let's mark out some "seed" nodes. These are the "nodes" of interest. To represent this, we use a binary vector - each slot in the vector represents one node in the graph. Let's start by highlighting two nodes, the second and third one:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">M</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reshape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>.reshape(A.shape[0], 1)</code> is done for convenience, so that each axis is aligned appropriately for the following matrix multiplication:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="n">M</span>
<span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">([[</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="p">]])</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After the end of one round, nodes 2 and 3 have no information held on them, but their neighbours do. Let's do two rounds of propagation, rather than just one.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="n">M</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">([[</span> <span class="mf">2.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">2.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">2.</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">[</span> <span class="mf">2.</span><span class="p">]])</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After two rounds of information, information is shared back with the original nodes, but not necessarily evenly - it all depends on the connectivity of each node.</p>
<p>It'll get really verbose doing 100 rounds; imagine doing <code>A @ (A @ (A @ (A @ .....)))</code>. Instead of doing that, a recursive function may be better. At the same time, with many rounds of network propagation, we will end up with really large numbers. Therefore, it will be helpful to also normalize the result of matrix multiplication.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">normalize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arr</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>On a previous blog post, I've alluded to the fact that recursive functions are pretty darn useful!</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2><p>So, let's take a look at the result of a few rounds of propagation.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2017/10/22/network-propagation/figure_1_sm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first thing that I'd like to highlight is that the information propagation process converges on a final result fairly quickly. The second thing I'd like to highlight is that the purple nodes (there are two lines!), which weren't highlighted at the start, ended up having the highest propagation scores, followed by the red node.</p>
<p>For those who are familiar with Markov chains, I believe network propagation has strong parallels with that.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Network propagation is conceptually simple, and easy to implement in Python.</p>

  <p>A few years on after trying out PyPy for the first time and wrestling with it, I still find it to be pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Now that PyPy officially supports <code>numpy</code>, I'm going to profile a few simple statistical simulation tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing the mean of a number of random number draws.</li>
<li>Simulating many coin flips</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll profile each of the tasks four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure Python implementation running from the CPython and PyPy interpreters</li>
<li><code>numpy</code> implementation running from the CPython and PyPy interpreters.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how do PyPy and CPython fare? Let's show the results up front first.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/10/11/pypy-impressive/profile.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/10/11/pypy-impressive/profile-sm.png" alt="Profiling results."></a></p>
<p>Click on the image to view a higher resolution chart. The raw recorded measurements can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QB1hF7Z8SGYjvll8sYCjVYEYAgzL4pjqGt1dbO6B2Co/edit?usp=sharing">on Google Sheets</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a description of what's happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>(top-left): PyPy is approx. 10X faster than CPython at computing the mean of 10 million random numbers.</li>
<li>(top-right): When both are running <code>numpy</code>, the speed is identical.</li>
<li>(bottom-left): When simulating coin flips, PyPy with a custom <code>binomial()</code> function is about 3X faster than CPython.</li>
<li>(bottom-right): When using <code>numpy</code> instead, there is a bottleneck, and PyPy fails badly compared to CPython.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty clear that when PyPy is dealing with "pure" data (i.e. not having to pass data between Python and C), PyPy runs very, very fast, and, at least in the scenarios tested here, it performs faster than the CPython interpreter. This is consistent with my previous observations, and probably explains why PyPy is very good for code that is very repetitive; the JIT tracer really speeds things up.</p>
<p>That last plot (bottom-right) is a big curiosity. Using the code below, I measured the random number generation is actually just as fast as it should be using CPython, but that PyPy failed badly when I was passing in a <code>numpy</code> array to the <code>Counter()</code> object (from the standard library). I'm not sure what is happening behind-the-scenes, but I have reached out to the PyPy developers to ask what's going on, and will update this post at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I heard back from the PyPy devs <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2680/slow-speed-going-from-numpy-data-structure">on BitBucket</a>, and this is indeed explainable by data transfer between the C-to-PyPy interface. It's probably parallel to the latency that arises from transferring data between the CPU and GPU, or between compute nodes.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? It means that for pure Python code, PyPy can be a very powerful way to accelerate your code. One example I can imagine is agent-based simulations using Python objects. Another example that comes to mind is running a web server that only ever deals with strings, floats and JSONs (in contrast to matrix-heavy scientific computing).</p>
<p>Now, for those who are curious, here's the source code for the <strong>pure Python implementation of the mean of random numbers</strong>.</p>
